The Beat Kangz Beat Thang Virtual [BLP] is a software version of the Beat Thang hardware device, which was created by a group of hip-hop producers and musicians known as the Beat Kangz. The software has the same interface and functionality as the hardware, but it runs on your computer instead of a separate device.
 
The software allows you to create your own beats using over 3,000 sounds and samples that are included in the library. You can also import your own sounds or use VST plugins to expand your sonic palette. You can arrange your beats in patterns and songs, and apply effects such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, and more. You can also record vocals or instruments directly into the software using a microphone or an audio interface.
 
The software also has some unique features that make it stand out from other DAWs. For example, you can use the BTV Solo mode to play and record your beats using only your computer keyboard. You can also use the Auto Chop feature to slice any sample into smaller pieces that you can rearrange or manipulate. You can also use the Graffiti feature to add scratches and turntable effects to your beats.
